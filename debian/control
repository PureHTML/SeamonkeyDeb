Description: Seamonkey web browser installer
 The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to develop the SeaMonkey Internet Application 
 Suite (see below). Such a software suite was previously made popular by Netscape and Mozilla, 
 and the SeaMonkey project continues to develop and deliver high-quality updates to this concept.
 Containing an Internet browser, email & newsgroup client with an included web feed reader, H
 TML editor, IRC chat and web development tools, SeaMonkey is sure to appeal to advanced users, 
 web developers and corporate users.
 .
 Under the hood, SeaMonkey uses much of the same Mozilla Firefox source code which powers such 
 products as Thunderbird. Legal backing is provided by the SeaMonkey Association (SeaMonkey e.V.).
